# Daughters & Poles

_Hello fellow dad,_

Chris Rock, my favorite comedian, said this:

> As a dad, you have only one job to do: Keep your daughter off the pole!...If she's dancin' on a pole; you f%$@ed up!

Now... 

It might not be a pole per se, but if your daughter has to do anything demeaning to gain approval from other men, i.e., "pole", as a father, you've f%$@ed up.

I think about how I can help my daughter continue to build her own self worth without having to rely on validation from others and it's one thing:

Acknowledge her effort.

Acknowledging is giving my full attention to what she's doing. Making it known and heard, let her talk through the accomplishment and helping her learn how to celebrate it.

As a dad, there are other things (maybe even more interesting) seeking for my attention — **BUT** I either give her my attention now or regret it in the future.
