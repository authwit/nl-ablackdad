# What’s With the Danes? - Part 2

_Happy Wednesday fellow Dad,_

Few days ago I started sharing my reflection on what I, a black dad can learn from the Danes with the lovely book, _[The Danish Way of Parenting: What the Happiest People in the World Know About Raising Confident, Capable Kids ][1]_.

[Here’s lesson 1 - 5][2], moving on to more lessons:

6. __Praise is closely connected to how kids view their intelligence__. If they are constantly praised for being naturally smart, talented, or gifted (sound familiar?), they develop what is called a “fixed” mind-set (their intelligence is fixed and they have it).
7. __Answer with honesty__ If your kids ask a question, give them _an honest answer_
8. __Use examples from your own childhood__. Whether it’s the doctor’s office or a difficult situation or just a fun time, kids like to hear about your experiences and how you felt when you were little,
9. __Teach honesty.__ Talk with your children about how important honesty is in your family.
10. __Read stories that encompass all emotions.__ Read all kinds of stories to your child. Don’t be afraid if they don’t all have happy endings. Actively choose stories that have difficult topics too, and stories that don’t conclude in a “storybook” way. __Children learn a lot from sadness and tragedy__ (being age appropriate, of course).
11. __Don’t color the experience of you kids with “rosiness”__.

I’d love to read what you think. What has been your own everyday reality?

_Your fellow Dad,_
