# In Search for Dad

Hello fellow Dad, 

With the distraction in the world today, I hope you get a moment to reflect on how to be a better dad?

Is it the time you’re able to spend with the kids. Quality time.

Is it being able to learn to continue to be a better husband to your wife.

A focus on continuing to improve yourself and being a better person overall.

The fact is, you have to continue to lead yourself before leading your family right. More importantly, you have to find yourself, as a Dad before being found by your kids.

Continue to remain in search of Dad.

Your fellow Dad,
Dele
