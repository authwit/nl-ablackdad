# Will I Ever Find Happiness?
## A Dad’s Search for Happiness
Hello fellow Dad,

With the stress of family life and work, finding happiness is hard. Today, I want to share what truly makes you happy, from one of the richest man in the world, [Jack Ma][1] inspired by [this answer][2] on Quora.

---- 
_Jack Ma once said he was a happier man when he WASN'T a billionaire. Why_?

_According to one of the richest men in China, Jack Ma, he was a happier man before he became a billionaire._

_Paraphrasing what Jack once said, "When I was younger, I would often dream of becoming a business tycoon who would lord it over others while enjoying a cigar, as seen in the movies."_

_Yet nothing was further from the truth!_

_For the higher he climbed, the more challenges the highly revered business leader realized he needed to handle._

_As he added, "The money I have today is a responsibility. It's the trust of people on me"._

_Indeed, a true leader isn't just hungry for more power or wealth, but is one who is a great steward & committed to taking on more responsibility._

_For with great power comes great responsibility!_

_Learn to take on more responsibility in serving your people and the society, and great power will come naturally to you._

---- 
A dad’s first responsibility is to his family, then start working outwards to serve more of the community that will make you and your family’s life better.

This is what brings satisfaction and ultimately, real happiness.

Your fellow dad,
- Dele
