# My Trails of Examples
I enjoy watching my daughter and son grow. I savor the challenge  ahead — what the world will throw at me — how will I cope?

Then it occurred to me:

It all starts from me and what I can do to live up to a standard I set for myself. That's all that matters.

I want to set an example. 

Not by asking them to do but how they can emulate me and suppass me.

As the grow, I continue to enjoy this challenge and I hope they are too.
