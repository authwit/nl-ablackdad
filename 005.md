# What's With the Danes - Part 3

_Happy Wednesday fellow Dad,_

And here come the final part of lessons from the Danes on being a better black dad. Here’s [Part 1 - 5][1], [6 - 11][2]

And here’s the final bits:

12 . __Use process praise__ Remember that the most meaningful and useful praise is based on quality, not quantity. Keep the praise focused on the process or effort children put in rather than on innate abilities:  For example 
> “You studied hard for your test, and your improvement shows it. You went over the material many times, made cue cards, and quizzed yourself. That really worked!”

13.  __Don’t use praise as a default response__ Don’t overuse praise for things that are too easy. This can teach your child that he is only praiseworthy
14. __Focus on effort__— and keep it genuine. Be careful praising for failures or mistakes. Saying things like “Well done!” “You did your best!” “Better luck next time!” can be heard as pity. Focus on what they did accomplish and how it can be worked on. For example ,  
	\> “I know you missed the goal, but it was very close! Let’s get out and practice next week
15. __Teach children not to compare themselves with others__. They need to realize themselves

16.__ Highlight your unique and authentic perspective__, and your child’s, by saying “for me” Try adding “for me” after a sentence to emphasize your understanding that your experience of a given situation isn’t necessarily the same as your child’s.

17. **Tips for Empathy** 
	1. Understand your own empathic style
	2. Understand others 
	3. Notice and attempt to identify emotions 
	4. Read, read, read 
	5. Improve meaningful relationships	
	6. Be vulnerable
	7. Seek out empathy in others 

18. As parents, it’s important that we first examine our default settings, our natural inclinations as parents, so that we are better able to see where change is needed. __Taking the time to see ourselves in the mirror, and see what we are repeating from our own family cycles,__ This is the step toward powerful change and powerful parenting.
