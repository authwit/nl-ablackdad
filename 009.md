# It's Not About Perfection

Hello fellow black Dad,

I've f'ed up again, my kids expect better of me. That's my thought sometimes when I aim for perfection.

As a dad, the society imposes expectations on us and there's that need to live up to certain expectations. Lies.

There is no such thing as perfection.

Everyone and their games, painting the perfect picture on IG when we all know it's all a sham. A sham to make you look bad and they feel secretly better.

Relax.

There is no perfection.

Our goal is to continue to be the best we can be, to remain available for our kids, to give them the value that we know will make them grow, to make them a better person in this world, in our own way.

To make them the best they can be.

Not the best the society wants them to be or what other dads might think they should be, just the best you know they can be.
