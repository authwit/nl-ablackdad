# The Future is Hard.

What kind of person do you want your child to be in the future you have in mind?

As I think intentionally about this question, it forced me to a shift in how I focus my life and I lead my family.

Thinking about the future is hard. 

Being in the now is easy. 

It's easy being consumed by the short satisfaction of the "quick fixes." And that makes me think:

Is this the foundation I want to lay for their future?

Every single decision I make. I think:

I'm I doing the best I can, I'm I giving the best example possible, for this moment and for the future?

One that is good enough for my kids to emulate.

Time will tell.

## One thing I’m enjoying lately

Being indoors, a lot.
