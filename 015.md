# Kids & Uncertainity

Like most things in life, raising my kids is uncertain.

I hate uncertainity. 

As I go through this journey of being a black dad, I'm doing my best to bring order to the choas, pain and patience that it takes to raise my kids to be the best person they can be. 

I continue to experiment with these:

- Taking the time to listen to them. Really listen even if what they're saying can be incoherent (as I write this, they are 1.5yrs, and 3.5 years)
- Teaching them the value of them listening to me
- Trying my best to answer their "whys." And for those I can't go any further on, I try very hard never to say "...because I said so." Saying "I don't know, " seems better to me. At least they get the lesson that no one knows it all, not even dad.
