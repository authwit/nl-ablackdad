# What’s With the Danes - Part 1?

Few years ago, before Daddyhood, I read a mind shifting book on parenting that has shaped how I approached things, [The Danish Way of Parenting: What the Happiest People in the World Know About Raising Confident, Capable Kids ][1]

I’ve been reflecting on some of its lessons and want to share which hit home the most for me (so far):

1. __Parenting with authenticity__ is the first step to guiding children to be courageously true to themselves and others.
2. As a parent, when going through a difficult time, for example, smiling and saying everything is OK is not always the best course of action. __Self-deception is the worst kind of deception__ and is a dangerous message to send to our kids.
3. Having the bigger house or more stuff or enrolling your kids in all the right activities __can be a self-deceptive pitfall__.
4. If a Danish child scribbles a drawing very quickly and gives it to her parent, the parent probably wouldn’t say, “Wow! Great job! You are such a good artist!” She is more likely to ask about the drawing itself. “What is it?” “What were you thinking about when you drew this?” “Why did you use those colors?” Or perhaps she would just say thank you if it was a gift. 
5. __Focus on the task, rather than over complimenting the child__, is a much more Danish approach.

More to come in the next few days.
