# Never Trust Yourself

How do you get to perform at peak performance every day? Simple - make it a habit.

It's the "trick" of high-performers. They go from trusting themselves to making themselves automatically do the right things. How?

Think of it this way:

You can always swear that when you go to bed today (early! You promise yourself for the 13th time), you will wake up early enough to do all the things you need to do. Tomorrow comes, you snooze 5 times — that's one way to approach it.

Or...

You can work towards the habit of waking up early starting one small step and when you develop that habit developing another habit. It's much easier than trusting you will magically make it happen one day.
