# How to Teach Rebellion: A Simple Guide 

Hitting is a popular discipline with us black dads. Regardless of your background, this is never an option with your kids. 

Let me rephrase, if you hit your child for disciple, you're lazy. Try this instead:

Lead by example. Be firm.

Let's start with leading by example:

Don't underestimate how powerful building a rapport with your child can be. This helps you encourage them to watch what you do and how you do it (*I'm assuming you're doing what exemplary of course*). This is easier than yelling, "do this!", "do that!" — you save your sanity, your voice and your arm. 

With that clear. What is firmness?

How about this example:

You ask your child: "Eat two spoons of soup then you can play with your toy." She whines, kicks, and whines some more. You, being the considerate dad, whisper to yourself, "well, she can always eat next time, it's OK." You let her go play before finishing that 2 spoon.

You've made a mistake. You're not firm.

Congrats on teaching your kid a great lesson: don't take me, your dad, seriously. With a few more of these, the only option you will be left with is the lazy option, hitting.

Here's an approach: 

Stop giving in so easily. Stop letting your child learn that you can't make a request, stick to it and expect the same of him. Stop being the one that teaches your child that she shouldn't listen to you. You know what?

Today she's refusing your "small" ask. These small requests turn into full rebellion later. At that point, it's too late.
