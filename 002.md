# One Thing That Might Hold Your Family

_Happy Wednesday fellow Dad!_

You probably should pray every day even if you don’t believe in a God, or hate religion with fuming passion. 

That’s strange and here’s why:

You’ve probably heard the saying, “a family that prays together, stays together” there’s a reason to that but not the usual religious stuff.

It’s:

When you pray, you __speak positive things to yourself and that makes you do positive things__. Now, multiply that by a few more people and it has a multiplying effect.

Truth is, it doesn’t have to be prayers in the traditional sense. Meditating, reflecting, yoga, something that is somber and you’re doing it with your family — the key is, you and the family are taking time to do it together. That’s the magic!

It’s easy. Start with just you, close your eyes and say a few good things to yourself, after a while, invite the family.

It’s magical.
