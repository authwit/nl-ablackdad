# I’m a Dad first, Father Second
### A father donates sperm, a dad donates life
Today, I’m committing to sharing the inside stories of a black dad (me) to another black dad (you).

Let me clear the air first, why I’m I, and I suspect you, a dad first?

> A father is someone who believes that by donating his sperm for your creation, he has done his duty in life. 
> A dad is someone who gets up every day and does whatever he can to put a roof over your head, clothes on your back and food on your table. He might have to dig ditches, flip hamburgers, deliver pizzas, work in a factory — or all of the above. He might not own a suit and tie. He teaches the value of hard work not because he’s looking for help mowing the lawn, but because he knows idleness leads to trouble. He realizes his job is to make his children productive citizens, and to do that, he can’t always be his child’s friend.

The other day, someone told me there should be a manual for raising kids, I agree. Sadly, there’s none, I’m writing this as a private manual to myself, possibly for my future self too.

And you, my fellow dad, are that proverbial fly on the wall.

I’m a black dad of 2, a boy (1+) and a girl (3+). My hope through these letter is to share as I learn helping you be the best black dad you can be.

That’s not all. What’s more is in it for you?

1. You enjoy me doing a lot of work and report the best to you (research, experiments, difficult convos, etc.).
2. You get to read an unfiltered perspective from a young black dad raising a family in today’s world (it’s quite hard I admit).
3. You get to be part of a growing community of black fathers who support themselves.

Like you, I’m learning as I go along and I’m looking to share and grow with you.

A toast to our collective future.
