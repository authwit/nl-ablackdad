# Being Present

I’m making it my goal to be more present with my family this year. I’ve not being absent, but I might not have been fully present.

My commitment:

Even if it’s lesser time, the time I’m spending with my family must matter.

Why does your family matter to you?

With the state of today’s world, it’s now important to have the circle around you, your family, matter—regardless of the other demands on your time. They must matter.

Regardless of what today’s society might want to re-educate us into, as a black dad, you want to actively fight the urge to fit into a negative expectation.

For me:

I think of my process with my family as a journey. I have to show up every, for my wife and kids, do the hard work of being physically and emotionally present.

With all the distractions of today, it’s hard.

But then...

When all is said on done, our wives and kids, is all we have.
